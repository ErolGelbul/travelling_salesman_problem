<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## The Travelling Salesman

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP): given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest
possible route that visits each city and returns to the original city?

The program I built is capable of executing the following features:
1. Randomly generating a map of locations
2. Calculating the distance between locations
3. Generating a visiting order to find the shortest path
4. Visualising the path.
